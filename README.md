## Standards

As a code reuse initiative, this package should follow some standards so it can be easily used by anyone who wants to. Recently there has been an initiative to standardize the chunks of code everyone is building so the wheel must not be reinvented everytime someone needs to do something. There's a group [PHP-FIG (Framework Interop Group)](http://www.php-fig.org) that's behind this initiative of allowing the built libraries to be interchangeable between frameworks and systems.

There are already some standards marked as accepted (_final_): [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md), [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) and [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

**This package is PSR-2 compliant.**

Being PSR-2 compliant means this package can be easily installed by using [Composer](getcomposer.org) from the [Packagist](http://packagist.org) package archive. Just follow the instructions in section [How to install](#how-to-install).
